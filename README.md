Diabetes Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

A Machine Learning project for predicting diabetes risk using structured clinical data.
This project is part of my research preparation for applying to PhD positions in AI & Digital Health.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze a medical dataset and develop machine learning models that can predict diabetes risk based on basic clinical features.
The project includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Model building using multiple ML algorithms

Model evaluation and comparison

Visualization of model performance (ROC Curve, Confusion Matrix)

Final conclusions based on metrics such as AUC, F1-score, and accuracy

This type of model can be used as a baseline for decision-support systems in digital health platforms.

🧠 Why This Project Matters

Chronic conditions such as diabetes create significant burdens on healthcare systems.
Early detection can help:

Reduce long-term complications

Improve patient outcomes

Optimize healthcare workflows

By using classical ML methods, this project builds a foundation for more advanced digital health AI systems (e.g., preventative analytics, patient triage, remote monitoring tools).
